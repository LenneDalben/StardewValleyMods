Description
Have you ever wondered why JojaMart, an alleged super-powered grocery store, doesn't even sell all seeds year round? Well, wonder no more, because now they do!

As it says on the tin, with Joja Always Has Seeds, Joja will sell seeds all year round. You'll receive a one-time letter from Morris when you install the mod advertising the change in stock.

keepsyou on Nexus Mods requested this, so I made it!


Compatibility
If you use Stardew Valley Expanded (SVE), you don't need this mod. If you use Joja Plans Ahead (or Joja 'May' Plan Ahead), make sure you remove that before installing Joja Always Has Seeds.


Installation
1. Install SMAPI﻿ (version 3.6.1 or higher)
2. Install STF
Optional: if you'd like to receive the letter, you'll also need to install MFM﻿
3. Unzip the mod folder into Stardew Valley/Mods (if you don't want the letters or don't use MFM, delete the folder beginning with [MFM]).
4. Play the game using SMAPI!


Uninstallation
Delete the folders for this mod from your Stardew Valley/Mods folder.




Oh, hello, you made it down here. You see, I had a brief fix to remove 2 square brackets from default.json and add them in mail.json, and of course, updating the version numbers in the 2 manifest.json files (for MFM and for STF). I doubted Nexus would let these small edits go by, because they are known for "eating" small edits to text files. In order to ensure (hope, really) that this update makes it to Nexus instead of getting lost to the void, I'm adding this blurb here.
