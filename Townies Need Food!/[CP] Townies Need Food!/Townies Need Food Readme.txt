||Description||
With Townies Need Food (TNF), villagers will ask for cooked meals you can make in the kitchen, and reward you with gold and friendship. You'll have 7 days to complete the special orders. For the special orders to show up on the special orders board, you must have a kitchen, either from the first house upgrade, or from one of the mods listed in the Compatibility section. There are also milestone requirements (for orders involving the island recipes). In the Main version, there are no friendship requirements. In the Optional version, there are friendship requirements. For the full specifics, refer to the spoiler guide under Miscellaneous Files.


||Configuration||
Config Options
Repeatable: true or false, default is true
IncludeIslandContent: true or false, default is true (toggle special orders requiring recipes from the island)

With regards to the "sparseness" of the orders: the game picks from a pool of the available orders, so if you'd prefer to get through some of the vanilla special orders first, install this mod later in your playthrough.

Note that the mod does not come packaged with a config file. The config file will be generated after you run the game with the mod installed at least once.

In the Main version, there are no friendship requirements. In the Optional version, there are friendship requirements. Due to a limitation with the way the game reads modifications to the special orders, if your friendship decays enough that you no longer meet the requirement, you could get a crash. The Optional version of the mod still has friendship requirements because if you use a mod to remove friendship decay (like Friends Forever, or the specific option in CJB Cheats Menu), you won't be affected by this and can use the Optional file. If you do not use a mod to remove friendship decay, and you don't want to risk a crash, use the Main file.
