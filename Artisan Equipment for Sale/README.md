# (STF) Artisan Equipment for Sale
Welcome to the respository for my mods for Stardew Valley!

Have you ever been rolling in the gold, flooded with cash, or just had some extra money, but you can't craft mayo machines because you don't have enough earth crystals, and you thought to yourself, "it would be great if I could just buy some mayo machines with all this money"? Well, now you can!

With this mod, the shop owners in the valley (and in the desert) will sell artisan equipment after you have unlocked it, every Thursday, and only to their friends.
