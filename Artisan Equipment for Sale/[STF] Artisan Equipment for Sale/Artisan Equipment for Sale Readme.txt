Description

2. Install STF (version 1.0.6 or higher)
--if you'd like to receive the letters, you'll also need MFM﻿, but this is optional
3. Unzip the mod folder into Stardew Valley/Mods (if you don't want the letters or don't use MFM, delete the folder beginning with [MFM]).
4. Play the game using SMAPI!
