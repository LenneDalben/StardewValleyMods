-Pierre will send you a letter on the 28th of the month to let you know

*Optional files*
3 Days in Advance:
-Pierre will sell the next season's seeds starting on the 26th of the month (so he'll sell them on the 26th, 27th, and 28th)
-Pierre will send you a letter on the 26th of the month to let you know

7 Days in Advance:
-Pierre will sell the next season's seeds starting on the 22nd of the month (so he'll sell them from the 22nd-28th)

*Optional files continued: Pierre 'May' Plan Ahead*
'May' Plan Ahead 1 Day in Advance:
-Pierre has a random chance to sell the next season's seeds on the 28th of the month
-Pierre will send you a letter on the 27th of the month to let you know to check his shop the next day

'May' Plan Ahead Up to 7 Days in Advance:
-Pierre has a random chance to sell the next season's seeds from the 22nd-28th of the month, from the 26th-28th of the month, only on the 28th of the month, or not at all
-Pierre will send you a letter on the 22nd of the month to let you know to check his shop that week

'May' Plan Ahead Draylon Edition:
-Pierre has a random chance to sell some of the next season's seeds, so it's not guaranteed he'll sell all types of the next season's seeds (or any seeds, if all of the random checks roll false!)
-Pierre has a random chance to sell the next season's seeds on any, some, or none of the days between the 22nd-28th. He could sell a seed on the 22nd that he doesn't sell the rest of the week, or he could sell it only on some of those days, or not at all!
-Pierre will send you a letter on the 22nd of the month to let you know to check his shop that week

For 1.2.1 update to Pierre Plans Ahead - 3 Days in Advance, the fix was pretty small, simply adding .text to the end of the winter letter in the MFM component (thank you Quirinea for reporting!). Because the change was so small, Nexus is likely to eat the update so I'm writing this blurb here in the hopes that Nexus doesn't eat the update and it actually goes through. Please nexus, bear with us even though SDV modding consists of small text files and updates sometimes really are small tweaks to text files.
