# (STF) Pierre Plans Ahead
Have you ever wanted to plan ahead, just a little, and have your seeds ready to go on Day 1 of the season, without having to wait for Pierre to open, to then run to Pierre, to then buy the seeds, to then run back to your farm and finally get to planting? Well, now you can!

1 Day in Advance:

-Pierre will sell the next season's seeds on the 28th of the month

-Pierre will send you a letter on the 28th of the month to let you know
