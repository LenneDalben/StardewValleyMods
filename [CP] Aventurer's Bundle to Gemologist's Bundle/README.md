# (CP) Adventurer's Bundle to Gemologist's Bundle
This mod changes the Adventurer's Bundle to instead be the Gemologist's Bundle. Pairs well with Non-Lethal Weapons and pacifist runs as a whole.

The requirements will now be 2 of the following combinations:
1 Ruby
1 Diamond
3 Topaz (stacked)
3 Emerald (stacked)

The configuration file is to toggle this mod on and off, so the only options are true and false. The default is true. 


Note that the mod does not come packaged with a config file. The config file will be generated after you run the game with the mod installed at least once.
