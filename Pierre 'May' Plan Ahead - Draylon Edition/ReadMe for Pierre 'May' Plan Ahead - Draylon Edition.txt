"Pierre 'May' Plan Ahead - Draylon Edition" (AKA complicate your life edition)
Author: LenneDalben

Description:
This version is more complicated than the others, so I thought a readme would help!
Pierre could sell some of the next season's seeds up to 7 days in advance, and even then, it's not guaranteed he'll sell them the rest of that week, or even sell all of the next season's seeds. Enjoy the randomness!

More detailed:
-Pierre has a random chance to sell some of the next season's seeds, so it's not guaranteed he'll sell all types of the next season's seeds (or any seeds, if all of the random checks roll false!)
-Pierre has a random chance to sell the next season's seeds on any, some, or none of the days between the 22nd-28th. He could sell a seed on the 22nd that he doesn't sell the rest of the week, or he could sell it only on some of those days, or not at all!
-Pierre will send you a letter on the 22nd of the month to let you know to check his shop that week
