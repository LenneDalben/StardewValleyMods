Description
With this mod, Joja's inventory is expanded to include basic cooking ingredients (tortilla, oil, and vinegar), fishing gear (after you unlock it), and coal, at a discount, even for non-Joja-members! To compete more with Pierre, Gus, Clint, and Willy, non-Joja-members will have a 25% off discount, while Joja members have a 50% off discount. The items and discounts are year-round. You'll receive a one-time letter from Morris when you install the mod advertising the additional stock.

I think the mod Lore-Friendly Joja Prices will pair well with this one, but note it's not required, https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2658 


Installation
1. Install SMAPI﻿ (version 3.4 or higher)
2. Install STF (version 1.0.4 or higher)
--if you'd like to receive the letter, you'll also need MFM﻿, but this is optional
3. Unzip the mod folder into Stardew Valley/Mods (if you don't want the letter or don't use MFM, delete the folder beginning with [MFM]).
4. Play the game using SMAPI!


Uninstallation:
