# (STF) JojaMart Has Extra Stock
Have you ever wondered why JojaMart is described in-game as having competitive prices, and lots of stock, but noticed it doesn't really have either of those? Well, with this mod, they're a little more competitive!

With this mod, Joja's inventory is expanded to include basic cooking ingredients (tortilla, oil, and vinegar), fishing gear (after you unlock it), and coal, at a discount, even for non-Joja-members! To compete more with Pierre, Gus, Clint, and Willy, non-Joja-members will have a 25% off discount, while Joja members have a 50% off discount. The items and discounts are year-round. You'll receive a one-time letter from Morris when you install the mod advertising the additional stock.
