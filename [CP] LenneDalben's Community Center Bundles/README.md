# (CP) Lenne's Community Center Bundles
This mod changes the community center bundles to add some Json Assets (JA) items, with 3 options: vanilla-twist (closest to the vanilla bundles, but with some items swapped for JA items), vanilla-lite (slightly easier with JA items), and vanilla-plus (slightly more difficult with JA items).

Configuration:

You have the options vanilla-twist, vanilla-lite, and vanilla-plus, or false, to toggle off the mod if you like.

Vanilla-twist:
These are most like the base game (vanilla) bundles, but with some items swapped for JA items.

Vanilla-lite:
These are the vanilla bundles with some options for JA items, so it's a little bit easier.

Vanilla-plus:
These are the vanilla bundles with some requirements for JA items, so it's a little bit harder.

Note that the mod does not come packaged with a config file. The config file will be generated after you run the game with the mod installed at least once. 

Nexus page TBD
