# (CP) Lenne's Community Center Bundles
This mod changes the community center bundles to add some Json Assets (JA) items, and each individual bundle can be toggled on or off, and has multiple options. There are 6 main options: twist (closest to the vanilla bundles, with some items swapped for JA items), lite (JA items added as options), and plus (JA items as requirements). Each of those have A and B variants: twistA, liteA, plusA, twistB, liteB, and plusB. Options with A have adjusted rewards. Options with B have vanilla rewards (unadjusted). I didn't adjust the rewards for 100% of the bundles because several seemed fine to me. There are also 21 "extras", which are varied bundles that don't require JA items, with A and B variants. Similar to the main options, I didn't adjust all the rewards for each bundle, since several seemed fine to me.

Configuration:

Main Options
You have the options twistA, twistB, liteA, liteB, plusA, plusB, or false, to toggle off the mod if you like. Options with A have adjusted rewards. Options with B have vanilla rewards (unadjusted).

Twist:
These are most like the base game (vanilla) bundles, but with some items swapped for JA items.

Lite:
These are similar to the vanilla bundles with some options for JA items, so it's a little bit easier than the Plus version.

Plus:
These are similar to the vanilla bundles with some requirements for JA items, so it's a little bit harder than the Lite version.

Extra Options
These are bundles that don't require JA items, but the requirements have been adjusted, and some of the rewards have been adjusted as well. There are A (adjusted rewards) and B (vanilla rewards) options, and each can be toggled on or off. Some have only true or false options in the config.

Note that the mod does not come packaged with a config file. The config file will be generated after you run the game with the mod installed at least once.
